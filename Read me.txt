To run the program firstly run the server exe file, then run the client exe file to join.
when a client joins they will be asked to enter a name, they will then be sent to the lobby screen.
the server can host up to 4 players.
from the lobby the clients can press the spacebar to ready up, once all players are ready you can press enter to begin the game.
at any point in the lobby or during the game the client can press the escape key to disconnect and exit the lobby/game.

When in game the clients can move their player using the WASD keys, they can also shoot in one of 4 directions using the arrow keys.
the goal is to shoot and eliminate the others players while avoiding their bullets, the last player standing wins.

from the win screen, players can press the enter key to return to the lobby.
